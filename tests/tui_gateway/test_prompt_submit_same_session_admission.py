"""Two concurrent ``prompt.submit`` calls for ONE session must admit exactly one turn.

``prompt.submit`` observed ``running`` under ``history_lock``, left the lock (the
``break`` that ends the idle observation), and only re-acquired it later, inside the
turn-claim helper, to flip ``running`` and start the in-flight turn. A second submit
for the same session could land in that gap, observe the same idle state, and start a
SECOND turn: two turn runners for one session, i.e. two ``pre_llm_call`` hook runs for one
prompt and duplicate delivery of whatever those runs emit. The observation and the claim
now happen under ONE ``history_lock`` hold, and the submit that finds the session already
claimed falls through to the pre-existing ``_handle_busy_submit`` contract
(queued / steered / redirected).

The probe makes that old window deterministic instead of hoping for a scheduling
coincidence: ``history_lock`` is wrapped so the release which ends an idle observation
parks its thread, letting a second submit run the entire admission path first.
